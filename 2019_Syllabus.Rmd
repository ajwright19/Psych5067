#### Course Descrition#### 

This course will provide a detailed overview of multiple regression as a data-analytic method. The course provides a conceptual background of the central ideas and applications along with the necessary applied skills to carry out analyses of continunous and categorical data. The analytic approaches are thus applicable to experimental research in which factors are manipulated and to observational research. Goals are threefold: (1) learn how to look at and think about data – to check for problems in regression models, errors in computer outputs, identify missuses of regression, (2) be able to examine the relationship among regression models, theoretical models, and your data, and (3) construct regression equations to examine specific hypotheses and interpret resulting models and regression coefficients.

#### Grading#### 
The class consists of 2 in class tests, a cumulative final exam,  7 "take home" projects, and one oral "exam". The 2 in class exams make up 40% of your grade (20% each). The final exam will account for 20%.  The 7 take home projects fulfills 35% of your final grade (5% each) while the oral exam will make up the remaining 5%. 

Typically, grades are "curved," but not curved to a predefined distribution. The curve will always be in a manner that will help people, not hurt. 

Due dates for exams and other project details will be listed on the announcements/home page. Expect exact dates to change throughout the semester so be sure to check the site frequently. 

Note: take home projects should be treated like exams. No discussing of questions or sharing code. Any duplicate code will result in zero points for that section.
