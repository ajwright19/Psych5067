#### Please answer the questions below. Show all your code and results. You will need to use the Dawtry et al., 2015 Psychological Science article and the accompanying dataset (found on the data page) to answer questions 1 - 7. 

#### Turn in your assignments via email to: Takehom.r8bmtely2bxeavd5@u.box.com by attaching the rmd and pdf to the email.

1. Using data from Dawtry et al. Study 1a, calculate cronbachs reliability for redistribution attitudes. (Note, some items may need to be reverse scored).  

2. Replicate the correlation matrix in Table 1. (Note: you will have to create a composite to do so)   

3. Calculate the means and standard deviations for Table 1 variables. 

4. Graph the distributions of Household Income, Fairness and Satisfaction, Social circle mean income, population mean income, and political preference. Comment on anything you find irregular or interesting.  

5. Run a regression where political preferences predit redistribution. Interpret the intercept, the regression coefficient and R2. Then create a scatter plot with a best fit line between redistribution and political preference variables. 

6. Dichotomize the political preferences data into a dichotomous conservative and democrat variable, assuming the midpoint is conservative. Then run a linear model with dummy coding predicting redistribution. What are the conceptual differences between the regression in #5 and #6. Which one would you prefer?  

7. Calculate a 95% confidence interval around the mean for each of the values in table 1. (Hint, don't do this "by hand")

*You do not need to use any data to answer questions 8 & 9.*

8. You are given data with two variables, X and Y. The mean of X is 3 with a SD .75. Y has a mean of 4 with a SD of .50. The correlation between the two is r = .3. "By hand", calculate the regression equation. Interpret each term in equation. 

9. "By hand," convert the equation in #8 into a standardized regression equation. Interpet each term. 

*You will need to use the anxiety data to answer questions 10 - 14.*

10. Using the Anxiety data, run a regression with Social Support (X) predicting Anxiety(Y). Then run a regression with Anxiety predicting Social Support. What is similar and different between these analyese? 

11. Graph the regression with Anxiety as the DV. Include confidence band and raw data points.  

12. For the regression of Social Support predicting Anxiety, correlate the fitted values with: a. residuals, b. Social Support, c., Anxiety. Explain the patterns you find.   

13. Using the anova function for the model output, calculate R squared "by hand" using numbers in the anova table.  

14. For the same model, interpret the residual standard error.
