Turn in via email to: Takehom.krrrtmtti39wm685@u.box.com by attaching 1) an rmd or a rnw file of your code and answers and 2) a pdf of said file. Use your last name to label the files (e.g,. "Jackson_takehome2") and include your name as part of the document front/top-matter.

All take home projects are **INDEPENDENT** projects; do not share code or discuss answers.   


#### Please answer the questions below. Show all your code and results. You will need to use the anxiety data to answer questions 3 - 11.

1. You are given data with two variables, X and Y. The mean of X is 3 with a SD .75. Y has a mean of 4 with a SD of .50. The correlation between the two is r = .3. "By hand", calculate the regression equation. Interpret each term in equation. 

2. "By hand," convert the equation in #1 into a standardized regression equation. Interpet each term. 

3. Using the Anxiety data, run a regression with Social Support (X) predicting Anxiety(Y). Then run a regression with Anxiety predicting Social Support. What is similar and different between these analyese? 

4. Graph the regression with Anxiety as the DV. Include confidence band and raw data points.  

5. For the regression of Social Support predicting Anxiety, correlate the fitted values with: a. residuals, b. Social Support, c., Anxiety. Explain the patterns you find.   

6. Using the anova function for the model output, calculate R squared "by hand". Interpret. 

7. For the same model, interpret the residual standard error. 

8. Using the group variable to predict Support, run a regression using a. existing group "factor" labels, b. transforming the factor scores into dummy codes with tx = 0, c. dummy codes with control = 0 and 4. effect codes. Interpret each term and then compare and contrast results across models.
