All take home projects are **INDEPENDENT** projects; do not share code or answers.   

1. You are given data with two variables, X and Y. The mean of X is 3 with a SD .75. Y has a mean of 4 with a SD of .50. The correlation between the two is r = .3. "By hand", calculate the regression equation. Interpret each term in equation. 

2. "By hand," convert the equation in #1 into a standardized regression equation. Interpet each term. 

3. Using the Anxiety data, run a regression with Social Support (X) predicting Anxiety(Y). Then run a regression with Anxiety predicting Social Support. What is similar and different between these analyese? 

4. Graph the regression with Anxiety as the DV. Include confidence band and raw data points.  

5. For the regression of Social Support predicting Anxiety, correlate the fitted values with: a. residuals, b. Social Support, C., Anxiety. Explain the patterns you find.   

6. Using the anova function for the model output, calculate R squared "by hand". Interpret. 

7. Using the group variable to predict Support, run a regression using 1) group "factor" labels, 2) transforming the factor scores into dummy codes with tx = 0, 3) dummy codes with control = 0 and 4) effect codes. Interpret each term and then compare and contrast results across models.
