All take home projects are **INDEPENDENT** projects; do not share code or answers.   

1. You are given data with M SD and a correlation between r = . By hand, calculate the regression equation. Interpret each term in terms of the variables. 

2. Convert #1 into a standardized regression euqation. Interpet each term. 

3. Using the xxxx data, run a regression between X and Y. Then run a regression between Y and X. What is similar and different between these analyese? 

4. Graph the regression. include confidence band and raw data points.  

5. For the regression of X predicting Y, correlate the fitted values with: a. residuals, b. Xs, C., Y.  

6. Using the anova function for the model output, calculate R squared "by hand"

7. Using the XX data, run a regression using 1.) factor scores, 2.) dummy codes, 3. effect codes. Compare and contrast results.
