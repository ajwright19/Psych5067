Please use the th.project.3 dataset to answer the questions below. These data were from a study where physical health was predicted by a happyness measure, socioeconomic status, number of close friends, and a 16 week mood intervention where here was a waitlist control group (0), a positive self affirmation intervention group (1) and a mediation group (2). 

1. Run a semi-partial and a partial correlation for health and friends, controlling for SES and happiness using simple regression analyses. 

2. Perform a multiple regression where Health is regressed on friends SES happiness. Interpret each coefficient. 

3. Graph the (2-d) relationship between health and happy as found in the above regression. Make sure the association controls for the remaining variables in the model. 

4. For the above regression, calculate variance explained and residual standard error using the anova table

5. Include the group variable mood.group into the regression model from #2. 
  a) Interpret the new coefficients
  b) Is there a significant increase in variance explained compared to the initial regression in #2? 
  c) Recode the group coefficients to -1,0 and 1. Rerun the model. Interpret each regression coefficient   including the intercept.   

6. Check each of the six assumptions discussed in class. Note: not every assumption may be directly examined. Describe how you *would* test the assumption. 

7.	Examine possible outliers. Directly state what each plot tells you. Are there any cases that are suspicious?  What is the impact on the analysis of these cases, if any?
