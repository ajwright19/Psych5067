# (Roughly) Due: 2/1 
<br>
Turn in via email to: Take_Ho.314j8z82srucfpz5@u.box.com by attaching 1) an rmd or a rnw file of your code and answers and 2) a pdf of said file. Use your last name to label the files (e.g,. "Jackson_takehome1") and include your name as part of the document front/top-matter.  
<br>
All take home projects are **INDEPENDENT** projects; do not share code or answers.   
<br>
Note: "by hand" means using the formulas to calculate the answers. This is contrasted with the simpler way of using R functions. It is recommended to use R functions if the "by hand" method is not explicitly stated.

1. Load the HW_1 data into R. Create a 1) an informative plot/figure of the study variables and 2) a informative descriptives table of the study variables.  

2. Run a 1) t-test, 2) one way anova, 3) linear model (regression) with dummy codes 4)  linear model with effect coding and 5) correlation between two variables using the HW_1 data. Describe one similarity and one difference you see across the models. 

#### THE QUESTIONS BELOW DO NOT INVOLVE HW_1 DATA:

3. You are contacted by the deans office. They ran a correlation between Wash U SAT scores and happiness and found a correlation of r = .21061 with a sample of N = 600. They want to know if this is lower than a published meta-analytic estimate (.2554)? Do this "by hand". Treat the meta-analytic estimate as the "population" 

4. Create a 95% confidence interval around r = .30 "by hand" for sample sizes of N = 50 and N = 500. Interpret each CI in your own words and compare and contrast the two CIs.
