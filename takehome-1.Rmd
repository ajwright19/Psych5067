#Please answer the questions below. Show all your code and results. Dawtry et al., 2015 Psychological Science article and accompanying dataset are needed to answer questions 3 - 11.  
# 
# 1. You are contacted by the deans office. They ran a correlation between Wash U SAT scores and happiness and found a correlation of r = .21061 (N = 600). They want to know if this is lower than a published meta-analytic estimate (.2554)? Do this "by hand" and using an R function

# 2. Create a 95% confidence interval around r = .30 "by hand" and using an R function for sample sizes of N = 50 and N = 500. Interpret each CI in your own words and compare and contrast the two CIs. 

# 3. Using data from Dawtry et al. Study 1, calculate cronbachs reliabity for redistribution attitudes. (Note, some items may need to be reverse scored) 

# 4. Replicate the correlation matrix in Table 1.   

# 5. Calculate the means and standard deviations for Table 1 variables. 

# 6. Graph the distributions of Household Income, Fairness and Satisfaction, Social circle mean income, population mean income, and political preference. Comment on anything you find irregular or interesting.  

# 7. Create a scatter plot with a best fit line for redistribution and political preference variables.

# 8. Dichotomize the politcal preferences data into a dichotomous conservative and democrat variable, assuming the midpoint is conservative. Run bi-serial correlation. Now run a t-test. Run a Pearson Correlation. Run a one-way ANOVA. Then run a point bi-serial correlation. What are interesteing commonalities and differences across the tests? 

# 9. Using the newly created political preference group variable, calculate the correlation between support for redistribution and household income. Is the correlation between conservatives and democrats significantly different from one another? 

# 10. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for each of the values in table 1. 

# 11. What level of power would the authors have for population inequality and support for redistribution if the the population effect size is .15.
