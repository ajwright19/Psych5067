Note: "by hand" means using the formulas to calculate the answers. This is contrasted with the simpler way of using built in R functions. It is recommended to use R functions if the method of choice is not explicitly stated.

#### Please answer the questions below. Show all your code and results. You will need to use the Dawtry et al., 2015 Psychological Science article and the accompanying dataset (found on the data page) to answer questions 3 - 11. 

1.  You are contacted by the deans office. They ran a correlation between Wash U SAT scores and happiness and found a correlation of r = .21061 with a sample of N = 600. They want to know if this is lower than a published meta-analytic estimate (.2554)? Do this "by hand". 

2. Create a 95% confidence interval around r = .30 "by hand" for sample sizes of N = 50 and N = 500. Interpret each CI in your own words and compare and contrast the two CIs.   

3. Using data from Dawtry et al. Study 1a, calculate cronbachs reliability for redistribution attitudes. (Note, some items may need to be reverse scored).  

4. Replicate the correlation matrix in Table 1. (Note: you will have to create a composite to do so)   

5. Calculate the means and standard deviations for Table 1 variables. 

6. Graph the distributions of Household Income, Fairness and Satisfaction, Social circle mean income, population mean income, and political preference. Comment on anything you find irregular or interesting.  

7. Create a scatter plot with a best fit line for redistribution and political preference variables.

8. Dichotomize the political preferences data into a dichotomous conservative and democrat variable, assuming the midpoint is conservative. Run bi-serial correlation with redistribution. Now run a t-test with the same variables. Run a Pearson Correlation. Run a one-way ANOVA. Then run a point bi-serial correlation. Any interesting commonalities or differences across the tests? 

9. Using the newly created political preference group variable, calculate the correlation between support for redistribution and household income. Is the correlation between conservatives and democrats significantly different from one another? 

10. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for each of the values in table 1. 

11. What level of power would the authors have for population inequality and support for redistribution if the the population effect size is .15.
