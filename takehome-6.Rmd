Data (project 6 data) come from experiment 1 in Maglio & Polman (2014) where they examined whether a personâ€™s spatial orientation would affect perceived distance (Also see article). They conducted the experiment on a train. Half of the participants were headed eastbound whereas the other half were headed westbound. Participants were randomly assigned to indicate the subjective distance of one of the four subway stations.


1. Run a factorial ANOVA using the study 1 dataset. Interpret the SSs and Fs. 

2. What is the effect size associated with each of your terms? 

3. Conduct post hoc tests that are appropriate. Interpret the one's you are most interested in.  

4. Graph the results. Make sure you include error bars.

5. Run a power analysis to determine sample size needed for the effect sizes found in #2. (note: pwr package is a nice one to use but be sure to use the glm/regression one as opposed to the one-way anova. Also, pay close attention to the effect size requested. Those more adventurous can perform simulations to calculate power)

6. The power analysis in #5 does not give you the power for detecting differences between two cell means. Find the number of subjects needed for a effect size difference of .4 between two cell means.
