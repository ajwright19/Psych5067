1. plot the data, using an appropriate plot

2. Run a t-test. Interpret each important part of the output. 

3. Run a one-way ANOVA. Interpret each part of the output. 

4. Run a linear model (regression) with dummy coding (the default in R). 
a. Interpret each part of the output.  
b. What is similiar to your t-testa and ANOVA? 
c. What is different? 
d. what would happen if your IV was coded as a numeric (ie metric or continous or interval, etc) variable as opposed to a factor (nominal variable)?
e. Recode your IV as an ordinal variable. What does this change?   

5. Run a linear model with effects coding. How does this differ from the linear model in #4?

6. Run a linear model with more than two groups as a predictor. Run an ANOVA with the same variables. Compare and contrast difference remembering to use both the summary and the anova functions 

7. Save the residuals from the model in 6 as a new variable in a dataframe. 
a. what are the descriptive stats of this new variable?
b. For subject 5, show how the 1)model coefficients, 2) the participant's residual and 3) the participant's IV and DV create the regression equation
