## Prediction
- Our inferences are about populations
- Want to generalize to other samples

## Prediction
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pred.1 <- predict()
```


## When do we have a good model? 
- Does it include all relevent variables (remember our assumption)?
- Balance between parsimony and completeness

- "Building" models up or "pruning" models down



## Overfitting
- We don't always want the best model fit  

- This is because the model will be tuned to our particular random sample, but not other random samples

- we are "fitting the noise"  

- This would lead to poorer prediction of new samples. 

- Not only does the extra terms not help, they actually hurt! 

## Overfitting within a model
