Use MLM data found on the data page.  The data are currently in two different formats, what is known as wide and long. For multi-level models we need it in a long format. These data come from a longitudinal study of negative and positive affect at four different waves across four years. Each are measured on a scale from 1-5. Additionally there are two categorical variables: gender (females = 0) and mood intervention ( tx = 1, waitlist control = 0). 

Given we didn't cover long and wide formats in class, below is some code for changing variables from wide to long. You dont need to use this, it is just here for future reference. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mlm_data_long <- mlm_data %>%
gather( affect, value, 2:9) %>% 
separate(affect, c('affect', 'time' ), sep="T") %>% 
spread(affect, value) 

```

1. Load both MLM datasets. What are the dimensions (number of variables, number of subjects) of each of these dataframes? How do they differ? 

2. Run a multi-level (with the lme4 package) using the long dataset where negative affect is your DV, and it is predicted by time. Make both time and intercept random. Interpret the output as best as you can. 

3. Run a normal linear model (using the lm function) with negative afect as your DV and time as your predictor. How does this model differ from the model you ran in #2 in terms of coefficient estimates, standard errors and residuals? Based on the output, which model would you prefer?
