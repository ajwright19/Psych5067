## casual relationships
- does parent SES cause better grades?
    + r(gpa, ses) = .33, b = .41
- potential confound of peer relationships
    + r(ses, peer) = .29
    + r(gpa, peer) = .37
    
## Multiple ways variables can relate
- spurious relationship
- indirect (mediation)
- moderate (interaction)
- multiple "causes"

## multiple regression model

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}+...+b_{p}X_{p}  $$


## Coefficient of Determination

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{reggression}} {SS_{Y}} = \frac{s_{\hat{Y}}^2}{s_{Y}} $$


## GPA = SES + Peer relationships
-Can be thought of as overlapping Venn diagrams

## types of correlations
- pearson ignores all outside variables

## types of correlations
- semi-partial  
    + the extent to which the part of X1 that is independent of x2 correlates with all of Y
    
## semi-partial
<img src="/Users/Jackson/Box Sync/5067 Regression Spring/regression/R2-2.png" width="500" height="500"/>

## semi-partial
$$ sr = r_{y(1.2)} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}} $$
$$ sr^2 = R_{Y.12}^2 - r_{Y2}^2 $$

## types of correlations
- partial  
- the extent to which the part of X1  that is independent of X2  is correlated with the part of Y that is also independent of X2 

## partial correlation
<img src="/Users/Jackson/Box Sync/5067 Regression Spring/regression/R2-3.png" width="500" height="500"/>

## partial correlation
$$ pr = r_{y1.2} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{Y2}^2}\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}} $$

$$ sr = r_{y(1.2)} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}} $$

## partial correlation

$$ pr^2 = \frac{R_{Y.12}^2 - r_{Y2}^2}{1-r_{Y2}^2} $$

$$ sr^2 = R_{Y.12}^2 - r_{Y2}^2 $$



## when to use what? 
 - semi-partial is best suited to show incremental variance (more practical)
 - partial is more effective to rule out third variable 
(theoretical)
- partial will be larger

## same t-test for semi-, partial and partial regression coefficient

## how to interpret partial regression cofficients? 
- residual in simple regression can be thought of as a measure of Y that is left over after accounting for your DV
- partial correlation can be created by:  
    1. create measure of X1 independent of X2
    2. create measure of Y independent of X2
    3. correlate new measures

## interpretting multiple regression model
$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}+...+b_{p}X_{p}  $$  
- intercept is when all predictors = 0  
- regression coefficients are partial regression coefficients  
- predicted change in y for a 1 unit change in x, holding all other predictors constant  

## example
```{r, echo = FALSE}
Multipleregression <- read.csv("~/Box Sync/5067 Regression Spring/regression/Multipleregression.csv")
```

```{r}
mr.model <- lm(Stress ~ Support + Anxiety, data = Multipleregression)
summary(mr.model)
```

## visualizing multiple regression

```{r}
library(visreg)
visreg2d(mr.model,"Support", "Anxiety", plot.type = "persp")
```



## OLS
- similar to before
$$ \hat{z}_{Y} = b_{1}^*Z_{X1} + b_{2}^*Z_{X2}$$
$$ minimize \sum (z_{Y}-\hat{z}_{Y})^2$$

## standardized partial regression coefficient
$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

$$b_{2}^* = \frac{r_{Y2}-r_{Y1}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

## Notice similarity with semi-partial correlation

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$



$$ sr = r_{y(1.2)} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}} $$


## relationships among partial, semi- and b*  

- three different ways to represent same effect  
- all standardized  
- if predictors are not correlated, sr and pr equal  
    
## Original metric

$$b_{1} = b_{1}^*\frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X1}} $$

$$b_{1}^* = b_{1}\frac{s_{X1}}{s_{Y}} $$

## Intercept

$$b_{0} = \bar{Y} - b_{1}\bar{X_{1}} - b_{2}\bar{X_{2}} $$

## Multiple correlation R

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}} $$


## Multiple correlation R

- $\hat{Y}$ is a linear combination of Xs
- $r_{Y\hat{Y}}$ = multiple correlation = R

## Multiple correlation R

$$ R = \sqrt{b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}} $$
$$ R^2 = {b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}} $$

## sum of squares decomposition

$$  \frac{SS_{regression}}{SS_{Y}} = R^2 $$
$$  {SS_{regression}} = R^2({SS_{Y})} $$



$$  {SS_{residual}} = (1- R^2){SS_{Y}} $$

## significance tests

- R2 (omnibus)  
- Regression Coefficients  
- Increments to R2  
    
## R-squared

- Same as before  
- Adding predictors into your model will increase R2 â€“ regardless of whether or not the predictor is correlated with Y.    
- Adjusted/Shrunken R2 takes into account the number of predictors in your model  
    
## Adjusted R-squared

$$R_{A}^2 = 1 - (1 -R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1} $$

## test of individual regression coefficients

$$ H_{0}: \beta_{X}= 0 $$
$$ H_{1}: \beta_{X} \neq 0 $$

## test of individual regression coefficients

$$ se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-r_{xy}^2}{n-2}}} $$

$$ se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-R_{Y\hat{Y}}^2}{n-p-1}}} \sqrt{\frac {1}{1-R_{i.jkl...p}}}$$

- As N increases... 
- As variance explained increases... 

## Tolerance
$$ se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-R_{Y\hat{Y}}^2}{n-p-1}}} \sqrt{\frac {1}{1-R_{i.jkl...p}}}$$  
- what cannot be explained in Xi by other predictors  
- Large tolerance (little overlap) means standard error will be small.   
- what does this mean for including a lot of variables in your model? 

## what to include
- match population model (theoretically)  
- many variables will not bias parameter estimates but will increase degrees of freedom and standard errors, potentially

## methods for entering variables
- simultaneous
- hierarchically 

## simultaneous  
- how do you interpert the regression coefficient
- how do you interpret the fit of the model? 

## heirarchical / model comparison  
- When you want to see if the fit of one model is better than another  
- Aka incremental variance
    
## heirarchical / model comparison  
- Multiple models are calculated  
- Each predictor (or set of predictors) is assessed in terms of what it adds (in terms of variance explained) at the time it is entered   
- Order is dependent on a priori hypothesis
