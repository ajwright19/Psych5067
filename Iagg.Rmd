## Why is personality associated with better health?

## Doctor adherence especially important in older adulthood

## But why do these traits influence the propensity to adhere? 


- Health? 
- Forgetfulness?  
- Side effects?
- Costs?  
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
(not like people adhere all the time while others never do it)
```

## But why do these traits influence the propensity to adhere?  
<div class="columns-2">
- Health? 
- Forgetfulness?  
- Side effects?  
- Costs?  

<br>

- Look at within person variation in these factors   
- E.g., do traits influence the likelihood that, when meds are costly, one is more likely to skip?

## Sample 1 Health and Retirement Study

- N = 15,109 participants (60% female) who provided between 5 and 11 waves of data
- Bi-annual assessments beginning in 1992
N = 131,406 distinct measurements. 
- Adherence: In the last year, have you ever missed a dose, delayed refilling or not filled the prescription?
- Predictor: self-rated health
- Covariates: Age, education, gender, insurance coverage 

## Sample 2 Prescription Drug Survey
- N = 4808 from HRS in 2006
- Participants listed up to 10 medications that they are currently taking.
- For each medication...  
    + Adherence: Yes/No missed a dose, delayed refilling or not filled the prescription?  
    + Predictors: not important, side effects, costs are too expensive  

## Personality

- Conscientiousness was the average response to 10 adjective items (e.g., organized). 
- Neuroticism was the average response to 4 adjective items (e.g., nervous)

## Analyses
- Logistic multi-level models. Health variables are within person centered. Personality is grand mean centered. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Level 1 consists of repeated measures of adherence predicted by repeated measures of health, insurance status, etcetera

Level 2 consists of person level/between subjects variables that do not vary within person. Covariates and personality. 
```



Simplified overall model with yearly health as example:
$$ Adherence = {\beta}_{0}+{\beta}_{1}Covariates + {\beta}_{2} YearlyHealth + {\beta}_{3}Conscientiousness \\ +  {\beta}_{4}Conscientiousness*YearlyHealth  $$


## Longitudinal Analyses
### Are these predictors assocaited with nonadherence?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library (tibble)
self <- tribble(
  ~ Predictor , ~ "odds ratio" , ~ "   95% CI"  ,
                 "Health", .76, "[.73 .79]", 
                  "Conscientiousness",.70, "[.60 .78]", 
                    "Neuroticism",2.69, "[2.48 2.92]",
                    "Health*Conscientiousness","-", "-", "Health*Neuroticism", "-", "-")

kable(self, align = "lcc")

```


## Longitudinal Analyses

When health is poor, are you more likely to nonadhere given your personality?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library (tibble)
self <- tribble(
  ~ Predictor , ~ "odds ratio" , ~ "   95% CI"  ,
                 "Health", .76, "[.73 .79]", 
                  "Conscientiousness",.70, "[.60 .78]", 
                    "Neuroticism",2.69, "[2.48 2.92]",
                    "Health*Conscientiousness",0.87, "[0.81 0.94]", "Health*Neuroticism", 0.99, "[0.93 1.04]")

kable(self, align = "lcc")

```

## Summary

- Low conscientiousness and high neuroticism are related to nonadherence
<br>
<br>
- Conscientiousness people are more likely to adhere when in good health 
- Those low are less likely to adhere when faced with greater side effects 
<br>
<br>


## Summary

- Low conscientiousness and high neuroticism are related to nonadherence 
<br>
<br>
- Conscientiousness people are more likely to adhere when in good health 
- Those low are less likely to adhere when faced with greater side effects 
<br>
<br>
- Those high in neuroticism are more likely to adhere when medication is viewed as important
