## casual relationships
- does parent SES cause better grades?
    + r(gpa, ses) = .33, b = .41
- potential confound of peer relationships
    + r(ses, peer) = .29
    + r(gpa, peer) = .37
    
## Multiple ways variables can relate
- spurious relationship
- indirect (mediation)
- moderate (interaction)
- multiple "causes"

## multiple regression model

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}+...+b_{p}X_{p}  $$


## Coefficient of Determination

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{reggression}} {SS_{Y}} = \frac{s_{\hat{Y}}^2}{s_{Y}} $$


## GPA = SES + Peer relationships
-Can be thought of as overlapping Venn diagrams

## types of correlations
- pearson ignores all outside variables

## types of correlations
- semi-partial  
    + the extent to which the part of X1 that is independent of x2 correlates with all of Y
    
## semi-partial

<img src="~/Box Sync/5067 Regression Spring/Spring_2019/R2-2.png"width="700" height="500"/>


## semi-partial
$$ sr = r_{y(1.2)} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}} $$
$$ sr^2 = R_{Y.12}^2 - r_{Y2}^2 $$

## types of correlations
- partial  
- the extent to which the part of X1  that is independent of X2  is correlated with the part of Y that is also independent of X2 

## partial correlation
<img src="~/Box Sync/5067 Regression Spring/Spring_2019/R2-3.png" width="500" height="500"/>

## partial correlation
$$ pr = r_{y1.2} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{Y2}^2}\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}} $$

$$ sr = r_{y(1.2)} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}} $$

## partial correlation

$$ pr^2 = \frac{R_{Y.12}^2 - r_{Y2}^2}{1-r_{Y2}^2} $$

$$ sr^2 = R_{Y.12}^2 - r_{Y2}^2 $$

## multiple regression model

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}+...+b_{p}X_{p}  $$


## how to interpret multiple regression cofficients? 
- residual in simple regression can be thought of as a measure of Y that is left over after accounting for your DV
- partial correlation can be created by:  
    1. create measure of X1 independent of X2
    2. create measure of Y independent of X2
    3. correlate new measures

## interpretting multiple regression model
$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}+...+b_{p}X_{p}  $$  
- intercept is when all predictors = 0  
- regression coefficients are "partial" regression coefficients  
- predicted change in y for a 1 unit change in x, *holding all other predictors constant*  

## example
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
Multipleregression <- read.csv("~/Box Sync/5067 Regression Spring/Spring_2019/Multipleregression.csv")
```

```{r}
mr.model <- lm(Stress ~ Support + Anxiety, data = Multipleregression)
summary(mr.model)
library(psych)
describe(Multipleregression$Stress)
```

## visualizing multiple regression

```{r}
library(visreg)
visreg2d(mr.model,"Support", "Anxiety", plot.type = "persp")

```


## OLS
- similar to before
$$ \hat{z}_{Y} = b_{1}^*Z_{X1} + b_{2}^*Z_{X2}$$
$$ minimize \sum (z_{Y}-\hat{z}_{Y})^2$$

## standardized partial regression coefficient
$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

$$b_{2}^* = \frac{r_{Y2}-r_{Y1}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

## Notice similarity with semi-partial correlation

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$



$$ sr = r_{y(1.2)} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}} $$


## relationships among partial, semi- and b*  

- three different ways to represent same effect  
- all standardized  
- if predictors are not correlated, sr and pr equal  
    
## Original metric

$$b_{1} = b_{1}^*\frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X1}} $$

$$b_{1}^* = b_{1}\frac{s_{X1}}{s_{Y}} $$

## Intercept

$$b_{0} = \bar{Y} - b_{1}\bar{X_{1}} - b_{2}\bar{X_{2}} $$

## How to visualize "controlling for"
- example of x and y controlling for W. Taken from @nickchk 
1. What is raw data? 


## How to visualize "controlling for"
2.what difference in X is explained by W. See the mean difference when W is dichotomous

## How to visualize "controlling for"
3. residualize X on W. Notice the means. Run the regresion

## How to visualize "controlling for"
4. What difference in Y is explained by W. 

## How to visualize "controlling for"
5. residualize Y on W. Notice the means. Run the regresion


## Fit revisited
```{r}
mr.model$R2
```



## Multiple correlation R

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2} $$


## Multiple correlation R

- $\hat{Y}$ is a linear combination of Xs
- $r_{Y\hat{Y}}$ = multiple correlation = R

## Multiple correlation R

$$ R = \sqrt{b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}} $$
$$ R^2 = {b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}} $$

## sum of squares decomposition

same as before

$$  \frac{SS_{regression}}{SS_{Y}} = R^2 $$
$$  {SS_{regression}} = R^2({SS_{Y})} $$



$$  {SS_{residual}} = (1- R^2){SS_{Y}} $$
## Check your model 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

fit <- lm(hp ~ ., mtcars)
au <- broom::augment(fit)

au.gg <- au %>% 
  gather(x, val, -contains(".")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(val, .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~x, scales = "free")
```

##
```{r}
print(au.gg)
```


## significance tests

- R2 (omnibus)  
- Regression Coefficients  
- Increments to R2  
    
## R-squared

- Same as before  
- Adding predictors into your model will increase R2 â€“ regardless of whether or not the predictor is correlated with Y.    
- Adjusted/Shrunken R2 takes into account the number of predictors in your model  
    
## Adjusted R-squared

$$R_{A}^2 = 1 - (1 -R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1} $$

## Anova table

```{r}
anova(mr.model)
```


##  

```{r}
summary(mr.model)
```


## test of individual regression coefficients

$$ H_{0}: \beta_{X}= 0 $$
$$ H_{1}: \beta_{X} \neq 0 $$

## test of individual regression coefficients

$$ se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-r_{xy}^2}{n-2}}} $$

$$ se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-R_{Y\hat{Y}}^2}{n-p-1}}} \sqrt{\frac {1}{1-R_{i.jkl...p}^2}}$$

- As N increases... 
- As variance explained increases... 

## Tolerance
$$ se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-R_{Y\hat{Y}}^2}{n-p-1}}} \sqrt{\frac {1}{1-R_{i.jkl...p}^2}}$$  
- what cannot be explained in Xi by other predictors  
- Large tolerance (little overlap) means standard error will be small.   
- what does this mean for including a lot of variables in your model? 

## what to include
- match population model (theoretically)  
- many variables will not bias parameter estimates but will increase degrees of freedom and standard errors, potentially

## methods for entering variables
- simultaneous
- hierarchically 

## simultaneous  
- how do you interpret the regression coefficient
- how do you interpret the fit of the model? 


## endogeniety discussion ADD!!





## hierarchical / model comparison  
- When you want to see if the fit of one model is better than another  
- Aka incremental variance
    
## hierarchical / model comparison  
- Multiple models are calculated  
- Each predictor (or set of predictors) is assessed in terms of what it adds (in terms of variance explained) at the time it is entered   
- Order is dependent on a priori hypothesis

## R-square change
- distributed as an F
$$ F(p.new, N - 1 - p.all) = \frac {R_{m.2}^2- R_{m.1}^2} {1-R_{m.2}^2} (\frac {N-1-p.all}{p.new}) $$
- can also be written in terms of SSresiduals


## Model comparisons
```{r}

m.1 <- lm(Stress ~ Support, data = Multipleregression)
m.2 <- lm(Stress ~ Support + Anxiety, data = Multipleregression)
anova(m.1, m.2)
```


## model comparisons
```{r}
anova(m.1)
```



## model comparisons
```{r}
anova(m.2)
```

## model comparisons
```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(m.2)
```
## model comparisons
```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(m.1)
```

## model comparisons

```{r}
m.0 <- lm(Stress ~ 1, data = Multipleregression)
m.1 <- lm(Stress ~ Support, data = Multipleregression)
anova(m.0, m.1)
```



## partitioning the variance
- It doesn't make sense to ask how much variance a variable explains (unless you qualify the association)

$$R_{Y.1234...p}^2 = r_{Y1}^2 + r_{Y(2.1)}^2 + r_{Y(3.21)}^2 + r_{Y(4.321)}^2 + ...   $$

- In other words: order matters! 


## Group level multiple regression
- i.e., ANOVA models  
- Need to put numbers to our categories
- Dummy code is default
- Effect coding is an option
- Other types too (though most are unhelpful)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
one.way <- read.csv("~/Box Sync/5067 Regression Spring/Spring_2019/anova.csv")
one.way$group <- one.way$IV
one.way$group <- as.factor(one.way$group)
one.way <- one.way %>%
  mutate(group = fct_recode(group,
    "control"    = '0',
    "tx1"    = '1',
    "tx2"    = '2')) %>% 
  as_tibble()

library (broom)
```

## When working with factors
- know thy class
```{r}
class(one.way$group)
table(one.way$group)
```
- Many base R functions automatically convert character vectors to factors
- This is okay if you are just tossing into a regression model but problematic for many uses


## Group level multiple regression
```{r}
model.1 <- lm(drugs ~ group, data = one.way ) 
summary(model.1)
```

## What happened? 

- For every nominal/categorical variable that has more than 2 levels R (default R) automatically creates L-1 dummy variables  

- Each of these dummy variables consists of 0 & 1s just like before, except 1 group (the reference group) only is coded as a zero

- The interpretation of each coefficent is the difference between the group coded 1 and the reference group

## group means
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
(one.way %>% 
    group_by(group) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(drugs)) %>% 
    summarise(mean(drugs)))
```


## See what R is doing with contrasts function
- a part of every factor 
```{r}
contrasts(one.way$group)

# Can see the same with only 2 levels
contrasts(Multipleregression$group)
```

## reordering
- no inherent order, so what does R spit out at you first? 
- default is alphabetic, but what if you wanted it by another variable

```{r}
levels(one.way$group)
one.way$group.2 <- relevel(one.way$group, "tx2")
levels(one.way$group.2)
```

## 
```{r}
model.2 <- lm(drugs ~ group.2, data = one.way ) 
tidy(summary(model.2))
contrasts(one.way$group.2)
```


## contrasts
```{r}
## dummy variables via:
contr.treatment(4)
## effect coding via: 
contr.sum(4)
```

## Asign contrast to factor variable

```{r}
contr.sum(3)
contrasts(one.way$group) <- contr.sum(3)
model.3 <- lm(drugs ~ group, data = one.way ) 
tidy(model.3)
```
## effects (sum) coding
- note: intercept is the means of means
```{r}
library(psych)
describe(one.way$drugs)
table(one.way$group)
```
- you may want to do "weighted" effect coding

## 
```{r}
anova(model.3)
```
 - What does the ANOVA table look like for model.1 and model.2? 
 - note the df for SSregression/SSbetween
 

## what happens if you want a different reference group? 
- in addition to relevel (and fct_relevel in forcats) you can change the contrast matrix
```{r}
contrasts(one.way$group) <- contr.treatment(3, base = 2)
model.4 <- lm(drugs ~ group, data = one.way ) 
tidy(model.4)
```

##

```{r}
contrasts(one.way$group) <- contr.treatment(3, base = 3)
model.5 <- lm(drugs ~ group, data = one.way ) 
tidy(model.5)
```


## What happens if you have both nominal and continuous variables in the same model? 

```{r}
model.6 <- lm(drugs ~ group + alcohol, data = one.way ) 
tidy(model.6)
```

## how should you code variables to begin with?

- Easy enough to work with factor variables that have their level as their name
- No need to manually change (or create) a number associated with a level and use as.numeric
- For simple dichotomous variables, sometimes people do code 0/1 rather than tx/control for example
- Information could be lost without a code book, so best to name the variable what is coded 1 (e.g., tx or female rather than group or gender)


## Multicollinearity
