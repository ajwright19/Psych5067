## Goals for semester

- Analyze and interpret  general(ized) linear models

- Be able to graph your data

- Identify and diagnose problems when they arise

##Important links
- [Class website](https://josh-jackson.github.io/Psych5067/)

- [Class readings](https://josh-jackson.github.io/Psych5067/readings.html)

- [LSR](https://health.adelaide.edu.au/psychology/ccs/teaching/lsr/)

## Important information

- Most important information is on the slides

- Readings serve to suppliment and enhance

- Important equations will be presented via slides

##Goals for today
- Review of last semester

## What should you already know? 
- R

- visualizing data - histograms, density plots 

- scale of measurement 

- sampling distributions

- p-values and NHST

- effect sizes and confidence intervals

- power

## R, Rstudio, rmarkdown, knitr
- Know it, love it

- See also: projects, github, osf, shiny 

## Sampling distributions
- binomial, poisson, negative binomial 

- normal, t 

- F, chi-square

- standard error

## p-values 
- Definition

- Family wise error

- Issues with 

## effect size and CIs
- There is imprecision in all that you do

- Common effect size metrics?

- Interpretation and utility of CI? 

- How does the CI relate to the sample and sampling distribution? 

## Last thoughts
- Any questions? 

- Looking forward: Relationships, measurement and correlations
