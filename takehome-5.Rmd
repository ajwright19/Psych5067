Use the mtcars dataset that is a part of R to answer the questions below

1. Using the glm function, run a multiple regression with 3 predictors and a DV. Then run the same function using the lm function. What are the similarities, what are the differences between these two approaches? 

2. Run a logistic regression with am as your DV (transmission type, manual = 1) and hp and wt as your predictors (horse power and weight). Interpret your coefficients. 

3. What is the predicted probability for 180hp engine and 3000 weight?

4. Graph the relationship between horse power and transmission type (to do so you create predicted probabilities across the range of Xs; itnerplot and sjplot also can plot this).

5. run the same regression you ran in #2 but this time run a probit regression. How does this change the interpretation of your parameters? Is this analysis appropriate?
